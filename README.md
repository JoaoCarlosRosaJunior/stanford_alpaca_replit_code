This was the repo for the Stanford Alpaca project, which is edited to become a trainer for Alpaca-format datasets over Replit's 3B Code Model:

- The code for [fine-tuning the model](#fine-tuning).


## Overview

A trainer for Replit's 3B parameter code model.

## Dataset Format

Alpaca format datasets should be in the following format, in json:

- `instruction`: `str`, describes the task the model should perform. Each of the 52K instructions is unique.
- `input`: `str`, optional context or input for the task. For example, when the instruction is "Summarize the following article", the input is the article. Around 40% of the examples have an input.
- `output`: `str`, the answer to the instruction as generated by `text-davinci-003`.

We used the following prompts for fine-tuning the Replit model:

- for examples with a non-empty input field:

 ```
 ### Instruction:
 {instruction}
 
 ### Input:
 {input}
 
 ### Response:
 ```

- for examples with an empty input field:

 ```
 ### Instruction:
 {instruction}
 
 ### Response:
 ```

## Fine-tuning

We fine-tune our models using standard Hugging Face training code.
We fine-tune LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B with the following hyperparameters:

| Hyperparameter | LLaMA-7B | LLaMA-13B |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Batch size     | 128      | 128       |
| Learning rate  | 2e-5     | 1e-5      |
| Epochs         | 3        | 5         |
| Max length     | 512      | 512       |
| Weight decay   | 0        | 0         |

To fine-tune for Replit's model, first install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Below is a command that fine-tunes Replit-3B with an alpaca-formated dataset on a machine with 4 A100 80G GPUs in FSDP `full_shard` mode.

Replace `<your_random_port>` with a port of your own, `<path_to_replit_model>` with the path to your converted checkpoint and tokenizer or leave default for Replit's base code model, and `<your_output_dir>` with where you want to store your outputs.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \
    --model_name_or_path <path_to_replit_model> \
    --data_path ./<your_dataset>.json \
    --bf16 True \
    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 200 \
    --save_total_limit 2 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --weight_decay 0. \
    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --tf32 True
```

Note the given training script is meant to be simple and easy to use, and is not particularly optimized.
To run on more gpus, you may prefer to turn down `gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep a global batch size of 128. Global batch size has not been tested for optimality.

### Addressing OOM

Naively, fine-tuning a 7B model requires about 7 x 4 x 4 = 112 GB of VRAM. Commands given above enable parameter sharding, so no redundant model copy is stored on any GPU.
If you'd like to further reduce the memory footprint, here are some options:

- Turn on CPU offload for FSDP with `--fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap offload"`. This saves VRAM at the cost of longer runtime.
- In our experience, DeepSpeed stage-3 (with offload) can at times be more memory efficient than FSDP with offload. Here's an example to use DeepSpeed stage-3 with 4 GPUs with both parameter and optimizer offload:
    ```bash
    pip install deepspeed
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \
        --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \
        --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \
        --bf16 True \
        --output_dir <your_output_dir> \
        --num_train_epochs 3 \
        --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
        --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \
        --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
        --evaluation_strategy "no" \
        --save_strategy "steps" \
        --save_steps 2000 \
        --save_total_limit 1 \
        --learning_rate 2e-5 \
        --weight_decay 0. \
        --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
        --deepspeed "./configs/default_offload_opt_param.json" \
        --tf32 True
    ```
  - The DeepSpeed library also provides some [helpful functions](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/memory.html) to estimate memory usage. 
- [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) fine-tunes low-rank slices of the query, key, and value embedding heads. This can reduce the total memory footprint from 112GB to about 7x4=28GB. We may release our re-implemention of this in the future, but for now the [peft](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) codebase can be a useful resource.
